# Virtual-MakeUp-Application

### Made use of the following technologies and platforms to complete this project
|    Tools and Platforms   |
| ------------- |
| Google Drive API      | 
| Google Colaboratory      | 
| Python3 | 
| dliv |
| face_recognition library |

The goal of this project is to pull an image from the Google Grive using Google Drive API [click here](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/quickstart/python) using python or any language that you prefer and apply make up on the image pulled using python libraries.

# Input image:
